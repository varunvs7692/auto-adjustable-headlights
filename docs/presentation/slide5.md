# Key Components

**Components Overview:**

- Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04): Detects nearby objects, such as pedestrians or obstacles.
- V2V Transceiver Module: Enables communication between vehicles for early detection.
- Microcontroller (ESP32 or Arduino): Processes sensor data and controls the headlight adjustments.
- Servo Motor (SG90): Adjusts the headlight angle dynamically for optimal illumination.
- LED Headlights: Provides bright, energy-efficient lighting with adjustable focus.
- Antenna System: Facilitates reliable V2V communication over necessary distances.
