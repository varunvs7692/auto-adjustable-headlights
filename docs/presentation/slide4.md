# Working Principle

**Detection:**

- Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04): Scans for objects within 15 cm.
- V2V Transceiver Module: Communicates with approaching vehicles using wireless signals.

**Processing:**

- Microcontroller (e.g., ESP32): Analyzes data from sensors and V2V communications.

**Adjustment:**

- Servo Motor (SG90): Tilts or dims headlights based on input from the microcontroller.

**Reset:**

- Headlights return to their original position when no hazards are detected.
