# Auto-Adjustable Headlights with Vehicle-to-Vehicle Detection

## Project Overview

Design an auto-adjustable headlight system that tilts the headlights downward when an object or another vehicle is detected within 15 cm to prevent glare.

## Working Principle

1. Detection: Ultrasonic sensor and vehicle-to-vehicle detection sensor continuously scan for objects or vehicles.
2. Measurement: If an object or vehicle is detected within 10 cm, sensor signals the microcontroller.
3. Adjustment: Microcontroller controls motor, tilting the headlight downward.
4. Reset: Headlight returns to original position when the object or vehicle moves away.

## Key Components

- Ultrasonic Sensor: Measures distance of objects.
- Vehicle-to-Vehicle Detection Sensor: Detects other vehicles.
- Microcontroller: Processes sensor data and controls headlight position.
- Servo/Stepper Motor: Adjusts headlight angle.
- LED Headlights: The light source being controlled.
- Power Supply: Provides power to the system.
- Relay Module/MOSFETs: Switches headlight brightness or activates tilt adjustments.

## Advantages

- Improves Road Safety: Prevents blinding pedestrians and drivers.
- Fully Automatic: No manual adjustment needed.
- Energy Efficient: Operates only when necessary.
- Enhances Driving Comfort: Automatic adjustments.
- Useful in Low Visibility: Maintains optimal visibility in foggy or rainy conditions.

## Applications

- Passenger Cars: Ensures safe urban and highway driving.
- Trucks & Buses: Prevents glare and improves visibility.
- Motorcycles: Adjusts headlight position dynamically.
- Construction & Off-Road Vehicles: Reduces glare in worksites.
- Emergency Vehicles: Enhances visibility without causing glare, improving response times.
- Autonomous Vehicles: Integrates with other systems to enhance safety and efficiency.
