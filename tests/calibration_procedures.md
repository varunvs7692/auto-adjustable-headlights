# Calibration Procedures

## Distance Calibration

1. Place an object at a known distance from the ultrasonic sensor.
2. Read the sensor value using the Arduino serial monitor.
3. Adjust the sensor range in the code to match the actual distance.
4. Repeat for different distances to ensure accuracy.

## Servo Calibration

1. Connect the servo motor to the Arduino.
2. Use the Arduino serial monitor to test different angles.
3. Adjust the angles in the code for optimal headlight positioning.
4. Test the servo movement in real-time to ensure smooth operation.
