# Test Plan

## Objectives

- Verify the functionality of the auto-adjustable headlight system.
- Ensure the system correctly detects objects and adjusts the headlights.

## Test Cases

1. **Initial Setup**
   - Verify all components are correctly connected.
   - Check power supply and connections.

2. **Distance Calibration**
   - Test the ultrasonic sensor's ability to measure distance accurately.
   - Adjust and calibrate the sensor range.

3. **Servo Calibration**
   - Test the servo motor's ability to adjust the headlight angle.
   - Fine-tune servo angles for optimal performance.

4. **Field Testing**
   - Conduct real-world tests to ensure system reliability.
   - Test in various environmental conditions (day, night, fog, rain).

## Test Environment

- Test Bench: Simulated environment for initial tests.
- Real-World: On-road testing for performance validation.
